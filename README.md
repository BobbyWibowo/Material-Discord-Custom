# Material-Discord-Custom

WORK IN PROGRESS.

Material design theme for Discord with modular fixes/tweaks/changes.

## BetterDiscord theme files

### Material-Discord-Custom.theme.css

This one contains all fixes, custom changes and plugin compatibilities.

This remotely loads [CapnKitten/Material-Discord](https://github.com/CapnKitten/Material-Discord) and `src/source.scss` (built files in `dist`).

Download: [https://bobbywibowo.github.io/Material-Discord-Custom/dist/themes/Material-Discord-Custom.theme.css](https://bobbywibowo.github.io/Material-Discord-Custom/dist/themes/Material-Discord-Custom.theme.css).

### Material-Discord-Custom-Overrides.theme.css

Same as above but with overrides, such as accent colors, font families, etc.

Basically for my own use only. What you'd want is the first one.

This remotely loads [CapnKitten/Material-Discord](https://github.com/CapnKitten/Material-Discord), `src/source.scss`, and `src/modules/all-overrides.scss` (built files in `dist`).
